Challenges faced during Task 6: Scraping Structured Data

1. Locating the correct HTML elements: 
   - The OWASP Top 10 page contains many sections and headings. Initially, it was unclear how to pinpoint exactly the top 10 risks.

2. Ensuring page fully loaded:
   - The page uses JavaScript to render content, so elements might not be immediately available.
   - Solution: Added a time.sleep(3) delay after loading the page to ensure all elements were present before scraping.

3. Writing to CSV in correct directory:
   - Needed to ensure the file saved in the correct folder (`python_homework/assignment9`).
   - Solution: Specified the full relative path when saving the CSV file or making sure we are in right directory.

Overall, the task was straightforward after careful inspection of the page structure and 
adding sufficient waits to avoid element not found errors.
